So, yesterday,  I have started working on the  implementation.  Nothing started, but continued working on implementation on gauge icon.  I had small discussion with Philip about some obstacles there.  I would need some input from you Marco, or you Flavia.  I don't know if you  guys, catch up the ticket.  And  after that,  we had like a pre-planning session  life  for the first time ever.  It was awesome. And yeah,  so today  I'm going to continue with the gauge icon and I have some ship  shipment to  probably do that in the second part of the day.  That's it.  Philipp: Awesome.  Yep. And so that it's in there and mentioned you  guys Marco and Flavia on Gitlab  and in the thicket regarding the go check. Maybe Ivan can you shortly share  the link in development Channel  or so?  Just to keep these guys in the loop,  then we will continue with Djuradj.'''\n",
